Short story about git:

Git was a quiet tool, organizing code like a librarian. For Alex, a new developer, it felt like a puzzle he could not solve. One day, faced with a confusing error, he felt completely stuck.

His mentor, Priya, stepped in. She explained Git as a time machine, tracking every change and saving him from mistakes. With her help, Alex resolved the problem and started to see Git as an ally, not an obstacle.
